# Introduction

Precipitation is an essential element for hydrologic modeling. The distribution of rainfall in a specific area provides necessary information for the climate. Thus, it is imperative that analyzes the distribution of precipitation. This project is going to create an interactive map for New York State. The map could provide the necessary information on precipitation, like mean, maximum, and minimum. The data and plots give a further understanding of the climate in New York State.

# Example
This picture is an interactive map from the USGS. However, it only shows the information about stations, like site number, site name, and agency. It is unclear about the precipitation. This project wants to improve the map by adding more details of precipitation. The updated interactive map could indicate the trend of precipitation by plot; it also could show the essential information for analysis.

# Data Source

All of the data is from the [USGS](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/ny/nwis/current/?type=precip&group_key=county_cd).There are 35 stations, which means there would be 35 marked signs in the map. Each station has the data of precipitation but the time period is varied. 

# Methods

This project will use some packages, for example, ggplot2, tidyverse, mapview, etc. Firstly, this project would download the data from the website directly. Because the time interval of data is 15 minutes, it is necessary that transform the interval to one day by sum the data in the same day. This step also transforms the time data to Date. Then, a list of data for each station would be created by order, and it is efficient that plotting each data set and saving to the list by for loop. Lastly, the spatial information would be inserted into each station, and the mepview function could create an interactive map.

# Results

The results would include the interactive map. For each marked dot, it would show a plot of precipitation during a recording time. It would also show the details for this station's precipitation, like mean, maximum, and minimum.
